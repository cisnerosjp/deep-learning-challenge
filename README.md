## The Task
Working for a fictional nonprofit Alphabet Soup, we are tasked to use machine learning and neural network techniques to see if applicants will be successful with their ventures if we provide them funding. We have to work through over 34,000 organizations that have previously received funding and work with several columns of metadata to complete this. The first step was to preprocess the data using pandas and scikit-learn's standardScaler. We were then tasked with compiling, training, and evaluating the model. We accomplished this by creating a neural network model. Next our task was to optimize the model. Lastly, we were tasked with writing a report on the neural network model. At the time of writing, this challenge is not fully completed and is considered a work in progress. 

## Navigating this repository
You can find a the code for this repository in the ChallengeCode folder. This folder holds the completed code in the form of "Challange_Code.ipynb" and our output file "AlphabetSoupCharity.h5". 

## Data Provided
For this challenge we were provided a dataset in the form of a link. The dataset can be reached at this link "https://static.bc-edx.com/data/dl-1-2/m21/lms/starter/charity_data.csv". We were also provided starter_code which held information such as variable names as well as imports that were used throughout the course of this challenge. The starter code also contained comments which directed what needed to be accomplished at each step. 

## Code Sources
The code in this repository was sourced from starter code provided by the bootcamp as well as from in-class work and activities, stack overflow, and documentation libraries for Pandas, TensorFlow, sklearn, and the Xpert for certain aspects of this challenge. At times I did have to utilize google for simple queries and information in order to see how to manipulate the databases.
